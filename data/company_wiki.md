# Evergreen Landscaping Co. Wiki

## Overview
Evergreen Landscaping Co. is a 50-year-old, family-owned landscaping business rooted in Lakewood, Ohio. What began in 1975 as a two-person mowing service run by the Miller brothers has evolved into a multi-division operation with **11 regional crews, 4,500+ recurring clients, and a reputation for craftsmanship that keeps second- and third-generation customers coming back**. Our team now spans residential enhancement experts, commercial account managers, snow and ice specialists, and an operations group that keeps every route running like clockwork.

Today, Evergreen operates under a hybrid business model: recurring maintenance contracts provide predictable baseline revenue, while design/build, irrigation, and seasonal projects drive growth and deepen client relationships. The leadership team combines legacy experience with modern, data-informed decision-making:

- **CEO & Co-Owner:** Emily Miller-Rodriguez (second-generation, strategy and community partnerships)
- **COO:** Marcus Ellis (operations, safety, fleet, logistics)
- **VP Sales & Growth:** Angela Park (field sales leadership, revenue enablement, partnerships)
- **Director of Horticulture:** Priya Nayar (plant health standards, innovation, training)
- **Controller:** David Kim (finance, procurement, vendor management)

**Our frontline reps and crew leaders are the face of Evergreen.** Every doorstep introduction, proposal walkthrough, and follow-up call represents the brand far more than our trucks or social feeds. This wiki exists to give new hires, veteran reps, and AI assistants shared context around Evergreen’s history, tone, and operating rhythm so every interaction feels consistent, informed, and “Evergreen.”

🟢 **Evergreen Tip:** Reference this wiki from the FieldOS Intelligence Center before every territory blitz—knowing the history and leadership context builds credibility with long-time clients.

## Mission & Values
Evergreen’s mission is simple: **“Elevate every outdoor space we touch, and every person who touches it.”** We believe landscaping is as much about people as it is about plants and stonework.

Our guiding values:

1. **Craftsmanship:** Details matter. From hand-edged beds to neatly coiled hoses, we leave visible proof of professional pride.
2. **Reliability:** We show up when we say we will, we weather storms (literally and figuratively), and we communicate before clients have to ask.
3. **Mentorship:** We invest in people so the next 50 years are even stronger. High-performing reps mentor apprentices; seasoned crew leaders coach new installers.

Our internal motto—**“No shortcuts.”**—started as a reminder on the shop wall and became the cultural glue. We use it to check decisions: Would taking this shortcut erode trust? Would it compromise safety, quality, or team growth? If so, we choose the longer, better path.

Values in action:

- **Customer Trust:** Honest proposals, proactive status updates, and crews that respect property lines.
- **Employee Development:** Paid certification programs, job-shadowing tracks, and regular “ride-along” coaching for sales reps.
- **Community Reputation:** Long-term clients recommend us because we’re as dependable in year ten as we were in year one.

🟢 **Evergreen Tip:** When drafting follow-ups or sales copy, start with craftsmanship, reliability, or mentorship language—it aligns instantly with leadership expectations.
