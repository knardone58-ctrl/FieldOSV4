# Landscaping Field Sales Playbook

## Introduction & Purpose
For five decades, GreenLine Services has transformed properties across the region—first with a single two-man crew and a push mower, now with full-service residential and commercial teams. Our 50-year legacy is anchored in a simple philosophy: **treat every property like it belongs to family, respond faster than the competition, and leave craftsmanship in plain sight.** Field representatives are the frontline ambassadors of that promise. Every conversation, estimate, and follow-up shapes how clients perceive our brand before an operations crew ever steps foot on site.

This playbook equips door-to-door and commercial reps to sell the GreenLine way. Whether you are knocking on a cul-de-sac in spring, renewing a snow contract for a logistics park, or advising a property manager who has been burned by “mow-and-go” outfits, the goal is the same: earn trust quickly, solve real pain points, and hand off jobs cleanly so crews can execute without surprises. Use this manual as your daily guide—review it when planning routes, prepping proposals, coaching newer teammates, or troubleshooting tough scenarios in the field.

- **Trust** means showing up prepared, backing every claim with a job story or photo archive, and never over-promising scope.
- **Responsiveness** means replying to new leads within two business hours, logging every call note, and giving updates before the customer has to ask.
- **Craftsmanship** means explaining how we’ll protect beds, trim edges, maintain equipment, and quality-check our work—even in the sales phase.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** You carry a 50-year legacy in every conversation; lead with trust, respond faster than expected, and set up operations for craftsmanship from the first hello.

## Territory Management & Daily Routine
High-performing reps own their territories like micro-franchises. They know which neighborhoods yield high-ticket installs, when HOAs host meetings, and which industrial parks value preventive maintenance. Plan routes to maximize face time, not drive time.

### Neighborhood Canvassing Best Practices
- **Prime windows:** Tuesday–Thursday from 3–7 pm captures homeowners returning from work; Saturday mornings reach weekend planners. Avoid early morning noise complaints.
- **Anchor accounts:** Start routes near visible flagship properties we already service—yard signage and well-kept beds provide instant social proof.
- **Micro-campaigns:** Rotate messaging by week (spring cleanups, irrigation tune-ups, seasonal color refresh). Keep leave-behinds aligned with the current push.
- **Weather awareness:** On rainy days, pivot to virtual follow-ups or commercial interior meetings; after storms, immediately canvas for tree and drainage remediation.

### Commercial Route Planning
- **Property clusters:** Group office parks, logistics hubs, and multifamily complexes within a five-mile radius to reduce gates and security check-ins.
- **Influencer mapping:** Log facility managers, procurement leads, and grounds committees separately. Schedule quarterly business reviews with top-tier accounts.
- **Seasonal pivot:** In late summer, prospect snow removal at industrial docks; in February, pre-book spring enhancements for HOAs before competitor bids flood in.

### Ideal Daily Rhythm
| Time | Focus | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7:00–8:00 | Prep | Review yesterday’s notes, confirm appointments, load truck with visuals, update canvassing lists. |
| 8:00–9:30 | Commercial drop-ins | Catch property managers before office hours escalate; deliver coffee or seasonal reports. |
| 9:30–11:30 | Scheduled walkthroughs | Residential estimates, landscape architect collaborations, site measurements. |
| 11:30–12:15 | Lunch & CRM logging | Update morning calls, send quick recap texts, adjust afternoon route based on weather. |
| 12:15–3:30 | Door-to-door blitz | Target two neighborhoods; capture photos, leave hangers, set evening appointments. |
| 3:30–5:00 | Follow-ups & proposals | Call warm leads, send “why us” videos, finalize same-day quotes. |
| 5:00–6:15 | Expanded canvassing | Hit high-visibility routes while homeowners are home; book next-day consults. |
| 6:15–7:00 | Day-end discipline | Log every touch in CRM, tee up tomorrow’s agenda, text operations about pending handoffs. |

### Seasonal & Weather Shifts
- **Spring:** Focus on cleanups, mulch refresh, irrigation startup. Double down on weekend events and HOA board meetings.
- **Summer:** Promote mid-season color, turf repair, irrigation audits. Schedule early morning canvassing to beat heat.
- **Fall:** Drive aeration, overseeding, leaf management, snow pre-season contracts. Use drone imagery for commercial snow pitches.
- **Winter:** Leverage case studies, design/build planning, retainers for snow and ice. Conduct customer satisfaction review meetings.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Own your calendar—prioritize high-yield windows, log every action daily, and pivot routes with weather and seasonal demand.

## Customer Discovery Framework
Discovery determines whether we quote efficiently or burn hours on mismatched jobs. Approach each conversation like a landscape doctor: diagnose before prescribing.

### Residential Qualifying Questions
- “What changes prompted you to explore landscaping help this season?”
- “How satisfied are you with your current lawn/bed maintenance on a scale of 1–10?”
- “Are there any upcoming events or deadlines we should plan around?”
- “How hands-on would you like to be with maintenance once the project is complete?”
- “What budget range feels comfortable if we can solve the entire list?”

### Commercial Qualifying Questions
- “Which service failures from previous vendors can we never repeat?”
- “How do grounds quality issues impact your occupancy or tenant satisfaction?”
- “Who signs off on scope changes and budget approvals?”
- “What KPIs does your leadership track for landscape or snow vendors?”
- “What timeline do you need for proposal, board approval, and onsite kickoff?”

### Buying Signals & Latent Needs
- Homeowners pointing out deferred maintenance, safety hazards, or neighbor comparisons.
- Property managers discussing tenant complaints, equipment downtime, or liability risk.
- Interest in bundled services (e.g., irrigation + plant health care) or multi-year agreements.
- Strong reactions to before/after photos or references—follow up by scheduling a site visit to completed jobs.

### Field Scripts
- **Opener (Residential):** “Hi, I’m Alex with GreenLine—the crew behind the Petersons’ front beds two doors down. We’re doing seasonal refreshes on the block and wanted to share a quick curb-appeal audit if you have two minutes.”
- **Opener (Commercial):** “Good morning, I’m Jordan with GreenLine Services. We partner with logistics parks like WestBridge to reduce slip-and-fall claims. Could we take a brief walk to identify winter prep priorities?”
- **Follow-Up Text:** “Hi Jamie, thanks again for the walk-through today. I’m drafting your ‘front beds + lighting’ options tonight and will send them by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Anything you want me to make sure we include?”
- **Objection – “Too expensive”:** “I understand. Most of our clients felt the same until they compared the full lifecycle cost. With our maintenance plan you get weekly quality checks and a 48-hour fix guarantee, which cuts rework and surprise invoices. Let me show you the basic tier that still covers the must-haves.”
- **Objection – “Need to talk to my spouse”:** “Absolutely—this is a joint decision. Would it help if I emailed a quick one-page summary with before/after photos and financing options? I can also stop by tomorrow evening to answer questions together.”
- **Objection – “We have a vendor already”:** “We respect good partnerships. When our current clients switched, it was because we offered proactive reporting, same-day storm response, and a single point of contact. Could we perform a complimentary audit so you can benchmark what you’re getting today?”

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Diagnose needs with targeted questions, listen for buying signals, and keep scripts handy to guide objections toward value instead of price.

## Proposal & Pricing Strategy
Deliver proposals within 48 hours (same day whenever possible). Present three options, anchor on value, and show that we understand both aesthetics and budget discipline.

### Service Tiers
- **Maintenance:** Weekly mowing, pruning, fertilization, seasonal color change-outs, mulch, leaf removal.
- **Design/Build:** Hardscapes, outdoor lighting, water features, retaining walls, full garden redesigns.
- **Irrigation:** Spring start-ups, mid-season audits, backflow testing, smart controller upgrades, winterization.
- **Snow & Ice:** Plowing, de-icing, sidewalk crews, snow hauling, storm monitoring, 24/7 dispatch.

### Example Bundles with Value Framing
- **Curb Appeal Kickstart (Starter):** Spring cleanup + mulch refresh + one seasonal color rotation. *Value:* immediate curb appeal boost for listing-ready homes.
- **Property Manager Peace of Mind (Core):** Weekly maintenance + monthly irrigation inspections + quarterly enhancement budget. *Value:* predictable invoices and tenant satisfaction.
- **Executive Estate All-In (Premier):** Weekly maintenance + design enhancement + holiday lighting + snow priority. *Value:* year-round coverage with one point of contact.

### Visual Estimates & Walk-Around Pricing Confidence
- Capture measurement photos and annotated sketches on the first visit.
- Use drone or satellite imagery for large commercial lots to confirm square footage and plow routes.
- Present a “good-better-best” sheet onsite—handwrite notes for specificity so the customer sees personalization.
- Mention craftsmanship cues (“We edge beds by hand where the stone meets turf to avoid scalping”) to differentiate from low-bid competitors.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Present three tailored options quickly, anchor on lifecycle value, and back pricing with visuals and craftsmanship cues to maintain margin discipline.

## Closing Techniques
Closing is about guiding a confident decision, not coercion. Keep momentum, reinforce fit, and make next steps effortless.

### Decision Framing Without Pressure
- Summarize agreed outcomes (“So we’re solving the drainage at the side yard, adding the lighting the HOA recommended, and locking in priority snow response.”)
- Highlight opportunity cost (“Locking in today locks your slot ahead of the first freeze, so crews can trench before the ground hardens.”)
- Reinforce risk mitigation (“Our 48-hour service guarantee means you never chase a crew for touch-ups.”)

### The 3-Option Rule
- **Good:** Meets baseline needs at entry price (maintenance essentials).
- **Better:** Adds enhancements or proactive services (maintenance + seasonal installs).
- **Best:** Bundles all high-impact services, includes premium warranty, faster response, and concierge touches.

### Psychological Triggers for Residential Customers
- **Social proof:** “Three neighbors on Maple Drive added the same lighting package last month—want to see night photos?”
- **Scarcity:** “We have two remaining design/build slots before graduation season. Shall we reserve one?”
- **Loss aversion:** “Delaying drainage work risks foundation washouts; this plan prevents those emergency costs.”
- **Personalization:** “We’ll match your front porch stone so the walkway looks original, not bolted on.”

### Closing Scripts
- “If the ‘Better’ option accomplishes everything we outlined and locks in priority snow response, are you comfortable moving forward so I can schedule the crew?”
- “Which of these three packages feels closest to the experience you want? We can fine-tune the details together once we pick the lane.”
- “Would it be helpful if we completed the agreement now while we’re on site? That way I can brief operations tonight and guarantee next week’s start date.”

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Frame decisions around desired outcomes, always offer three options, and use social proof plus urgency triggers to inspire confident yeses.

## CRM & Follow-Up Discipline
Our CRM is the single source of truth for leadership, scheduling, and customer support. If it’s not logged, it didn’t happen.

### Call Note Best Practices
- Enter call summaries within 10 minutes or before leaving the driveway.
- Use the format **[Need] + [Solution] + [Next Step + Date].**
- Attach annotated photos, measurements, and recorded voice notes directly to the opportunity.
- Tag operations when a scope includes special equipment, tight access, or neighbor coordination.

### Follow-Up Templates
- **Post-Visit Text (within 1 hour):** “Hi [Customer], thanks for showing me the property. I’m summarizing your [service] plan tonight and will send three options by [time]. Excited to earn your business.”
- **Proposal Delivery Email:** “Subject: Your Three Landscape Options – Ready for Review. Hi [Name], attached are the Good/Better/Best plans we discussed, complete with visuals and timeline. Reply with questions or tap the booking link to secure your install window.”
- **48-Hour Follow-Up Call:** “I wanted to make sure you received the proposal and see if there’s anything we should adjust. Most clients pick the core bundle because it balances curb appeal and maintenance. Shall we review together?”
- **Post-Install Check-In:** “You’ve had the new beds for a week—how are they looking? I’ll stop by Friday to inspect and photograph for your records.”

### Metrics to Track Weekly
- **Conversion Rate:** (Closed jobs ÷ total qualified opportunities). Target: 35% residential, 25% commercial.
- **Lead-to-Quote Ratio:** (Quotes delivered ÷ new leads). Target: 85% within 48 hours.
- **Average Follow-Up Attempts:** Minimum of 5 touches (mix calls, texts, emails) before recycling.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Log every detail fast, standardize follow-ups, and inspect your metrics weekly so nothing falls through the cracks.

## Performance Metrics & Incentives
When reps see their numbers daily, they course-correct without waiting for quarterly reviews. Incentives should reward behaviors that support revenue, retention, and brand reputation.

### Core KPIs
| KPI | Target | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Appointments Set per Day | 4 residential / 2 commercial | Keeps top-of-funnel strong |
| Close Percentage | 35% residential / 25% commercial | Measures discovery quality & proposal strength |
| Revenue per Route Day | $6,000 residential / $12,000 commercial | Balances volume and deal size |
| Retention Rate | 90% annual contract renewals | Ensures promises translate to delivery |

### Leaderboard & SPIF Ideas
- **Weekly “Route Captain”:** Top revenue per route day earns a $100 gear stipend and recognition at the Monday huddle.
- **Seasonal SPIF:** Close three design/build projects over $20k in spring to unlock a weekend getaway voucher.
- **Team Goals:** If the branch hits month-end close rates, everyone gets a Friday half-day once routing is complete.
- **Referral Bonus:** $250 bonus for every new client referral that signs a maintenance agreement.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Track KPIs daily, celebrate behaviors that drive pipeline health, and mix individual plus team incentives to keep morale high.

## Customer Experience & Hand-Off
Flawless execution starts with a clean handoff. Reps must transfer every nuance so operations can delight customers without backtracking.

### Handoff Protocol
1. **Internal Brief:** Within 24 hours of close, submit a handoff packet including scope summary, photos, marked-up site plan, and customer personality notes (e.g., “Works nights—schedule morning crews after 10 a.m.”).
2. **Ops Coordination:** Attend the first scheduling call to answer scope or pricing questions, then introduce the operations lead to the customer via three-way call or email.
3. **Job Folder:** Ensure the folder includes permits, utility mark details, plant selections, warranty promises, and post-care instructions.
4. **Pre-Visit Touch:** Send the customer a “What to Expect” message 48 hours before the crew arrives.

### Post-Sale Relationship Management
- Conduct a 7-day post-install walk-through with the customer, capture testimonials, and identify enhancement opportunities.
- Schedule quarterly “property health” calls for commercial accounts; bring snow managers or horticulture specialists as needed.
- Offer referral cards or digital reviews links immediately after customers express satisfaction.
- Log every upsell opportunity (lighting add-on, irrigation sensors) for seasonal outreach.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Hand off with precision, stay engaged after the sale, and use satisfaction moments to trigger referrals and upsells.

## Field Scenarios & Troubleshooting
Every territory throws curveballs. Be ready with play-tested responses so you maintain momentum and credibility.

### Scenario 1: Sudden Downpour During Door Canvas
- **Response:** Transition to vehicles or covered porches; offer storm clean-up assessments. Text existing leads to check on property damage (“We’re nearby with crews ready if you need limbs cleared tonight.”).
- **Tools:** Weather alerts, photo examples of post-storm work, quick-response crew availability.

### Scenario 2: Gatekeeper Blocks Commercial Access
- **Response:** Build rapport; ask for the property manager’s pain points (“What landscaping headaches should we take off their plate?”). Leave behind a maintenance scorecard showing common audit results.
- **Follow-Up:** Within two hours, email the gatekeeper a thank-you note and request an introduction. Add them as a contact in CRM; they can become an internal advocate.

### Scenario 3: Competitor Underbids
- **Response:** Reframe around lifecycle cost. Share the “cheap vs. craftsmanship” comparison sheet showing rework, storm damage risk, and liability exposure. Offer a trial enhancement or 30-day audit to prove value.

### Scenario 4: Customer Hesitates on Snow Contract
- **Response:** Highlight risk timeline, use NOAA storm data, and show priority response maps. Share testimonials from logistics managers who avoided loading dock shutdowns because of our proactive de-icing.

### Scenario 5: Crew Capacity Tight
- **Response:** Communicate immediately—set realistic timelines, explore phased installs, and offer interim services (e.g., temporary erosion control). Escalate to operations and update the customer twice weekly.

### Scenario 6: HOAs with Strict Design Guidelines
- **Response:** Arrive with compliance binder, plant lists, and digital mockups. Offer to present at the next HOA meeting with before/after case studies.

🔑 **Key Takeaways:** Anticipate obstacles, respond with proof and empathy, and log every scenario so the team can iterate on best practices.

**Commit to the process, respect the craft, and remember: every lawn, plaza, and rooftop garden is a billboard for our 50-year legacy.**
